# Web Application

The web application uses Vue.js with TypeScript for building a dynamic and maintainable frontend. We integrate MerakiUI for streamlined UI components.

## Vue.js and TypeScript Structure
We leverage Vue.js to create reactive and component-based architecture. The project is written entirely in TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better scalability.

## MerakiUI Integration
The UI components are powered by MerakiUI, providing a clean and modern design system. All components are customizable and reusable, which accelerates development and keeps the codebase consistent.

## Project Structure
- **Components**: Each page and feature is separated into Vue components, allowing modular development and easy maintenance.
- **State Management**: Vuex (or Pinia) is used for managing the application's state across components.
- **TypeScript**: All files are written in TypeScript for better type checking, making the code safer and easier to refactor.

## CSS and Tailwind
- **Tailwind CSS**: The styles are managed using Tailwind CSS classes within Vue components. This approach helps in writing minimal custom CSS and speeds up styling with pre-configured utility classes.

## JavaScript and Vue Features
- **API Integration**: We use Vue's `axios` or `fetch` to pull data dynamically from the backend.
- **Form Validation**: Custom validation logic is implemented using Vue.js and TypeScript, ensuring secure and correct user input.
